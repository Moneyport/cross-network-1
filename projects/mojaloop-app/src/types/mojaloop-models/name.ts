/**
 * The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular expression to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.  Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the Name type is \"^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,'-]{1,128}$\". The restriction does not allow a string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode characters are allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe (â€˜), dash (-), comma (,) and space characters ( ).  **Note:** In some programming languages, Unicode support must be specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used, the flag UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.
